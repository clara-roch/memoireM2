\section{Tree-regions model}
In order to simplify the model, we first run it with two countries and one regions: China, United State of America, and a region Rest Of the World (RoW); the production and consumption values of China and the United State are around zero and two order of magnitude smaller then the values associated to the region RoW (e.g. cereals consumption in RoW is evaluated at 4.01e11, while China's and USA's are respectively at 1.35e11 and 4.28e10; for sugar we have in the same order 1.17e11, 3.72e10, and 6.99e9), this allows us to consider this tree regions in parallel.



\section{Multi-countries model}
In the multicountry model, we consider a wider range of countries and agricultural products.


\section{Data}
\subsection{Data for initial equilibrium}
To calibrate the model, we use prices from FAOSTAT, and production and consumption from FABIO. Our prices are
