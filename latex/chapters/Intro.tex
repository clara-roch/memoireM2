We will study in this paper the effect of public policies in agriculture and their effects on greenhouse gaz emissions throughout trade.

Section \ref{intuition} presents a simple two-country model that examines the implementation of two agricultural public policies: the introduction of tariffs and the provision of production subsidies. The objective is to assess their impacts on greenhouse gas emissions through price equilibria, offering initial insights into how these policies may affect total emissions.

Section \ref{model} goes further by introducing a partial equilibrium model that incorporates multiple countries and production sectors. This model builds on the studies of Gouel and Laborde (2021) and Gouel (2025). However, rather than using a Frechet distribution to capture heterogeneity in the yield function, it employs a multilogit management function—with costs that increase with specialization—and represents yield using an isoelastic function, following Galichon (2016).

Section \ref{data} details the calibration of the model, utilizing data from FABIO and FAOSTAT.
