Section \ref{intuition} will expose a simple two countries model, facing an implementation of two public policies regarding agriculture: the introduction of tariffs and the provision of subsidies to production. The objective will be to see their effects on GHG throughout price equilibrium. This will give use first intuitions as to how these policies can effect total emission.

Section \ref{model} will go beyond these first intuitions, and presents a partial equilibrium model with multiples countries and sector of productions. 

Section \ref{data} will expose the model calibration, on FABIO and FAOSTAT data.
