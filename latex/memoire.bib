  abstract = {This paper details the properties of an agricultural supply model relying on the assumption that crop yields are distributed following a Generalized Extreme Value distribution. It shows how this model compares to existing modeling approaches, especially the one commonly used in computable general equilibrium model: the constant elasticity of transformation function. It proposes an estimation strategy based on a flexible auxiliary model.},
